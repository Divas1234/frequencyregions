**frequencyregions** is a Julia package and research project designed for exploring and visualizing the interplay between inertia, damping, and other parameters within power systems. It provides tools for analyzing frequency response characteristics and potentially visualizing stable operating regions in a multi-dimensional parameter space.

## Key Features

*   **Inertia-Damping Function Analysis:**
    *   Generates and plots inertia-to-damping functions based on droop parameters, allowing for the analysis of how changes in droop impact system stability.
    *   Dynamically labels plots for clear identification of different droop settings.
*   **Polyhedron Visualization:**
    *   Includes functionality to visualize spatially irregular polyhedra in 3D using GLMakie. This capability can be expanded to visualize stability regions in multi-dimensional parameter spaces.
*   **Automatic Workflow:**
    *   Includes a streamlined workflow for generating and analyzing these power system characteristics.
* **Power System Analysis**:
    * Allows for the research of parameters of power system.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   **Julia:** Ensure you have Julia installed on your system. You can download it from [https://julialang.org/](https://julialang.org/).
*   **Package manager:** Make sure you have `Pkg` which is the built-in package manager.
* **GLMakie**: make sure you install the library `GLMakie`.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/frequencyregions.git # Replace with your repository URL
    cd frequencyregions
    ```

2.  **Open Julia:**

    ```bash
    julia
    ```

3. **Activate Project**
    ```julia
    julia> ]
    (frequencyregions) pkg> activate .
    ```

4.  **Instantiate the environment:**

    ```julia
    julia> ]
    (frequencyregions) pkg> instantiate
    ```
5.   **Run Example scripts:**

    ```julia
    julia> include("enhanced_mainfunction.jl") # To run the inertia-damping analysis
    julia> include("demo.jl") # To run the polyhedra visualisation
    ```

## Usage

### Analyzing Inertia and Damping

The `enhanced_mainfunction.jl` script demonstrates how to analyze the inertia-to-damping relationship.

1.  **Define Droop Parameters:**

    ```julia
    droop_parameters = collect(range(33, 40, length = 20))
    ```

2.  **Generate and Plot:**

    ```julia
    plot_inertia_damping(droop_parameters)
    ```

This will generate a plot showing how inertia varies with damping for the given droop parameters.

### Visualizing Irregular Polyhedra

The `demo.jl` script shows how to visualize irregular polyhedra.

1. **Define vertices and faces:**

```julia
vertices_irregular = [
    [0.0,0.0,0.0], [1.0,0.0,0.0], [1.0,1.0,0.0], [0.0,1.0,0.0],  # Bottom square
    [0.0,0.0,1.0], [1.0,0.0,1.0], [1.0,1.0,1.0], [0.0,1.0,1.0]   # Top square
]

faces_irregular = [
    [1,2,3,4],     # Bottom face
    [5,6,7,8],     # Top face
    [1,2,6,5],     # Front face
    [2,3,7,6],     # Right face
    [3,4,8,7],     # Back face
    [4,1,5,8]      # Left face
]

plot_irregular_polyhedron(vertices_irregular, faces_irregular)
