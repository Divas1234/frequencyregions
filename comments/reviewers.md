Comments to the Author
This letter studies the H-D parameter set in the frequency response. The topic is interesting and timely. The reviewer has the following questions.
1. Although the H-D support set was established, the theoretical innovations should be highlighted. The modeling of frequency response is quite standard in the letter, the authors’ model formulation innovations should be explained.
2. The derivation of Eq. (1) should be explained more clearly. The system frequency response model should be given, such as the frequency response control block, etc.
3. Meanwhile, the inverter model should be explained with more details. The IBR’s frequency response should be given (virtual inertia, damping, droop, etc).
4. In the case study, the operating condition should be explained explicitly because the Delta_P impacts the maximum frequency deviation, this Delta_P is based on the operating condition.

This letter introduces a novel inertia-damping (H-D) set method for analyzing electrical power system frequency security against mismatch disturbances. The topic is timely and relevant, offering an interesting perspective that moves beyond traditional Rate-of-Change-of-Frequency, frequency nadir and quasi-stability-state frequency con-straints. The work does a commendable job of explaining the relationship between multidi-mensional frequency parameters and dynamic security. However, several problems need to be addressed to improve readability and overall quality:
1.The description of existing SFR methods in Section II could be more concise. It is sug-gested to refine this section to focus on the specific limitations of existing approaches, which can further effectively highlight the significance of this work.
2.The method relies on a predefined mismatch disturbance. Therefore, it is suggested to explain how the H-D support set changes with different disturbance levels. It is crucial for understanding the method's robustness and applicability under varying contingency se-verities.
3.Figure 4 introduces the influence of various droop parameters on the geometric config-uration of H-D support set. Please explain in detail how this influence can be applied to specific frequency-constrained operation problems.
4.This paper provides detailed open-source code and experiment results. It is suggested that the results and data be shared with the community to promote better dissemination of the work.


Reviewer: 3

Comments to the Author
This letter intends to propose a new criterion to assess frequency stability by considering multidimensional relationships between the frequency parameters. However, the reviewer thinks the authors fail to illustrate these issues clearly. The detailed comments are given as follows:
1.The reviewer does not recognize the uniform analytical expression of frequency dynamic processes by considering the high penetration of converters. The reviewer thinks that the expression in (1a) fails to describe the dynamic of the converters during the frequency disturbances.
2.The authors fail to clearly explain the process to obtain 4(a), which is a very important expression in the letter.
3.Some variables have not been explained in this letter.
4.The authors claim that HEQU = Q(DEQU) but do not explain the reason.
5.The analysis should be verified by simulations with the converters and synchronous generators.
